## Description

This is a simple, easy-to-use weather dashboard app. When a user searches for a city, they are presented with the main weather factors (temperature, wind speed, humidity, and UV index) for the current date, as well as an abbreviated forecast for the next five days. The app also stores eight of your most recent searches, so if you check several cities frequently, you can simply click on the button with that city's name in your search history.
